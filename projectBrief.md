## 🧪 Examples of Use Cases

### Math Example:

```
Q. ∫(3x²+2x+1)dx?

Soln:
=  3∫x²dx + 2∫xdx + ∫1dx
=  3⋅x³/3  + 2⋅x²/2 + x
=  x³ + x² + x + C
```

### Lab Simulation:

**Reaction between hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and potassium iodide (KI):**

```
2H₂O₂(aq) + KI → 2H₂O(l) + O₂(g)
```

### Real-time Interaction Example:

```
2H₂O₂(aq) + H₂SO₄ → 2H₂O(l) + O₂ (explosive release)

Student: What will happen if I add a strong acid like concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) instead of potassium iodide (KI)?
AI Teacher: *Responds interactively.*
```

## 🔁 User Flow Summary

1. **Student uploads a file** (TXT, DOC, PPT, PDF, Image).
2. **If PPT** → Displayed beside the AI teacher.
3. **If other formats** → Summarized → Converted to teaching slides → Displayed.
4. AI Teacher explains via board and hand animation.

### At any time, student can:

* Ask a question via voice (transcribed by Whisper) → AI responds with speech + board drawing.
* Launch a lab simulation → script triggers animation.
* Go back to previous slides.

**Everything occurs in front of a virtual AI teacher with tools nearby.**
